#
# Minimal Xorg service file - launches Xorg as a service unit
#

# The Xorg launch helper forks, launches Xorg and waits for Xorg to
# accept incoming connections to $DISPLAY, and then exits. This
# guarantees that services that require access to $DISPLAY during the
# session don't start too early.
#
# If you implement a service that requires access to $DISPLAY, your
# service unit file needs to include 'After=xorg.target'.
